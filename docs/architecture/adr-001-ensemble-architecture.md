# ADR-001: Ensemble Model Architecture

## Status
**Accepted** - 2024-01-10

## Context

We need to design a machine learning architecture for credit risk assessment that can:
- Achieve high accuracy (AUC-ROC ≥ 0.85)
- Provide explainable predictions for regulatory compliance
- Handle multiple data types (tabular, temporal, relational)
- Maintain fairness across demographic groups
- Support sustainable AI practices with energy efficiency

## Decision

We will implement an **ensemble architecture** combining multiple specialized neural networks:

1. **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** - For tabular features
2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** - For temporal sequences
3. **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** - For relational data
4. **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)** - For efficient sequence processing
5. **LightGBM** - As gradient boosting baseline

The ensemble will use **weighted averaging** with dynamic weights based on individual model confidence and performance on different data segments.

## Rationale

### Advantages of Ensemble Approach

1. **Performance**: Combines strengths of different architectures
   - DNN excels at tabular feature interactions
   - LSTM captures temporal dependencies
   - GNN models relationship networks
   - TCN provides efficient sequence processing
   - LightGBM offers interpretable baseline

2. **Robustness**: Reduces overfitting and improves generalization
   - Individual model weaknesses are compensated
   - Better handling of diverse data patterns
   - Improved stability across different market conditions

3. **Explainability**: Multiple explanation methods available
   - SHAP values from tree-based models (LightGBM)
   - Attention weights from neural networks (LSTM, GNN)
   - Feature importance from ensemble combination
   - Model contribution analysis

4. **Fairness**: Better bias mitigation through diversity
   - Different models may have different bias patterns
   - Ensemble averaging can reduce individual model biases
   - Multiple fairness constraints can be applied

### Technical Implementation

```python
class EnsembleModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {
            'dnn': DeepNeuralNetwork(),
            'lstm': LSTMNetwork(),
            'gnn': GraphNeuralNetwork(),
            'tcn': TemporalConvNetwork(),
            'lgbm': LightGBMModel()
        }
        self.weights = self._initialize_weights()
    
    def predict(self, X):
        predictions = {}
        confidences = {}
        
        for name, model in self.models.items():
            pred = model.predict(X)
            conf = model.get_confidence(X)
            predictions[name] = pred
            confidences[name] = conf
        
        # Dynamic weighting based on confidence
        final_prediction = self._weighted_average(predictions, confidences)
        return final_prediction
```

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Single Deep Neural Network
- **Pros**: Simpler architecture, faster training
- **Cons**: Limited ability to handle diverse data types, less robust
- **Rejected**: Insufficient for complex multi-modal data

### 2. Stacked Ensemble with Meta-Learner
- **Pros**: Potentially higher performance, learned combination
- **Cons**: More complex, harder to interpret, risk of overfitting
- **Rejected**: Added complexity not justified by performance gains

### 3. Mixture of Experts
- **Pros**: Specialized models for different data segments
- **Cons**: Complex gating mechanism, harder to explain
- **Rejected**: Explainability requirements favor simpler combination

## Implementation Details

### Model Weights and Combination

```yaml
ensemble_config:
  base_weights:
    dnn: 0.25
    lstm: 0.20
    gnn: 0.15
    tcn: 0.15
    lgbm: 0.25
  
  dynamic_weighting:
    enabled: true
    confidence_threshold: 0.8
    adaptation_rate: 0.1
  
  combination_method: "weighted_average"
  uncertainty_quantification: true
```

### Training Strategy

1. **Individual Model Training**: Each model trained independently
2. **Weight Optimization**: Validation set used to optimize ensemble weights
3. **Joint Fine-tuning**: Optional end-to-end fine-tuning of the ensemble
4. **Fairness Constraints**: Applied during weight optimization

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Ensemble Advantage |
|--------|--------|--------------------|
| AUC-ROC | ≥ 0.89 | +3-5% over best individual |
| Accuracy | ≥ 0.87 | +2-4% over best individual |
| Fairness | All metrics ≥ 0.80 | Better bias mitigation |
| Latency | < 100ms | Parallel inference |

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **High Performance**: Expected 3-5% improvement over single models
2. **Robustness**: Better generalization and stability
3. **Explainability**: Multiple explanation methods available
4. **Flexibility**: Can adjust weights based on performance
5. **Fairness**: Better bias mitigation through model diversity

### Negative Consequences

1. **Complexity**: More models to train, deploy, and maintain
2. **Resource Usage**: Higher computational requirements
3. **Latency**: Potential increase in inference time
4. **Storage**: Multiple models require more storage space
5. **Debugging**: More complex troubleshooting and debugging

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Model Optimization**: Use quantization and pruning to reduce size
2. **Parallel Inference**: Deploy models in parallel for speed
3. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring of individual models
4. **Fallback**: Single best model as fallback option
5. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation for maintenance
