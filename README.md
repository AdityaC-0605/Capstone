- `config/development.yaml`: Development overrides
- `config/production.yaml`: Production overrides

Environment variables can override any configuration setting.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up configuration:
   ```bash
   export ENVIRONMENT=development
   ```

3. Run the system:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES-256
- API keys and passwords are properly hashed and stored securely
- Comprehensive audit logging tracks all security events
- GDPR compliance features ensure data protection compliance
- Differential privacy protects individual privacy in datasets

## Next Steps

This foundation provides the core infrastructure for:
- Neural network model implementations
- Federated learning capabilities
- Model explainability features
