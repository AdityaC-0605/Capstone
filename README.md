## Features Implemented

### 1. Project Structure and Core Interfaces
- ✅ Modular directory structure for all components
- ✅ Abstract base classes for models, processors, and services
- ✅ Configuration management system with environment support
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and monitoring infrastructure

### 2. Data Security and Privacy Foundation
- ✅ **Encryption System**: AES-256 encryption at rest, key management with rotation
- ✅ **Anonymization Pipeline**: PII detection, k-anonymity, l-diversity, differential privacy
- ✅ **Access Control**: RBAC, API key management, JWT authentication, MFA support
- ✅ **GDPR Compliance**: Data retention policies, right-to-be-forgotten, consent management, data lineage tracking

## Security Features

### Encryption
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- Automatic key rotation policies
- Encrypted backup and recovery mechanisms
- Secure key storage and management

### Data Anonymization
- Automatic PII detection using pattern matching
- K-anonymity and l-diversity implementation
- Differential privacy with configurable epsilon
- Data masking and tokenization

### Authentication & Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (TOTP)
- API key management with permissions
- JWT token-based sessions
- Comprehensive audit logging

### GDPR Compliance
- Consent management and tracking
- Data retention policies with automated deletion
- Right-to-be-forgotten implementation
- Complete data lineage tracking
- Data subject request processing

## Configuration

The system uses YAML-based configuration with environment-specific overrides:

- `config/base.yaml`: Base configuration
- `config/development.yaml`: Development overrides
- `config/production.yaml`: Production overrides

Environment variables can override any configuration setting.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up configuration:
   ```bash
   export ENVIRONMENT=development
   ```

3. Run the system:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES-256
- API keys and passwords are properly hashed and stored securely
- Comprehensive audit logging tracks all security events
- GDPR compliance features ensure data protection compliance
- Differential privacy protects individual privacy in datasets

## Next Steps

This foundation provides the core infrastructure for:
- Neural network model implementations
- Federated learning capabilities
- Model explainability features
- Sustainability monitoring
- Production API deployment

Each component can be built upon this secure, compliant foundation.
